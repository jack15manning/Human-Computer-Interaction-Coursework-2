Introduction
------------
This project was completed as the second piece of coursework for the module "Human Computer Interaction" during the third year of my studies at The University of East Anglia. In this project I worked with another student to create a prototype redesign of our University Portal Website, with a focus on design, usability, and accessibility of the website. In particular, we aimed to satisfy Nielsen's 10 principles of User Interface Design (https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). It was developed using a HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript stack alongside a Python Flask local server. 


Installation
------------

Several libraries are required to run the prototype locally and can be installed using the following commands in the command line:

* Flask
```bash
pip install Flask
```
* WTForms
```bash
pip install WTForms
```

After installing the required dependencies, the prototype can be ran locally by using the following steps:
1. Clone this directory to your machine
2. Open a Powershell terminal in the downloaded folder
3. Run the Flask server using the following command:
```bash
python .\server.py
```
4. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
